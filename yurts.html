  <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong> What is a Yurt?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
      ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a
      wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>

    <dt><strong>How are yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt
      and a gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes
      electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower
      and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>

    <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
    <dd>"Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress
      for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also
      helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
